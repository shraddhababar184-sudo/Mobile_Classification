##  Mobile classification typically refers to categorizing mobile phones based on their features or communication systems. It can also mean using machine learning to predict a phone’s price range based on its specifications.

# 🤖 2. Mobile Price Classification (Machine Learning Perspective)
This involves using machine learning models to classify mobile phones into price categories based on their technical features. It’s a popular classification problem in data science:
- Dataset Features:
- Includes specs like RAM, battery power, screen size, number of cores, internal memory, camera resolution, etc.
- Target variable: Price Range (e.g., low, medium, high, very high).
- Goal:
- Predict the price category of a mobile phone using classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, or Random Forests.
- Use Case:
- Helps manufacturers or retailers estimate pricing based on features.
- Useful for market analysis and product positioning.
